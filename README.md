# UFOs Sighting Website

### Overview of the project

Build a website that provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, youâ€™ll be able to filter the table for the city, state, country, and shape.

- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Resources
- Sofware: Visual Studio Code
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

## Results: 

### Deliverable 1:

If one is curious to what sighting happened in a certain state, they just need to add the state name abbreviation and the results will filter accordingly. For example, if you want to see what sightings happened in Arizona, enter "ar" into the "Enter a State" box and it'll adjust the table to 3 sightings that happened in Arizona.

If one wants to narrow the search down even more, for example find a sighting event in a specific city in Arizona, they need to add the name of the city, in addition to the state name, to the "Exter a City" box and the table will populate automaticaly.  

## Summary:

### 1 Drawback:
- Design of this page could use some improvement, adding some dinamic visuals could make the page more interesting to look at. 
 
### 2 Recommendations: 
- Add a counter to show and keep track of how many sightings happened to date. 
- Add a map of the sightings to draw connections and have a better visual of the scope of this phenomenon.
